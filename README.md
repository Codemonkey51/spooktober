# Spooktober discord profile pictures

This is a very simple bit of code fore generating *spooktober* profile pictures. The only reason this is on github, is because I was asked to put it on github. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

# Usage

You name the input file `in.png`, and run the command `python main.py` (make sure packages are installed first though), the program should output the resulting image in the same folder, with it named `out.png`.
